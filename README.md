Working on implementing...

- Direct messaging between users (private)
- Search characters & worlds & users
- allow certain number of posts at a time (main feed, character page, world story, personal page) 
- when logged in, your feed shows characters and worlds you follow
- main world shows highest followed world/char feed
- make a sample page to show how it's played
- visibility

IN THE FUTURE:

- allow notices
- able to add dices (for D&D role playing)
- ...like? maybe? hmm..
